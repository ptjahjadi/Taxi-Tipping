# Taxi-Tipping
## Aim
The aim of this project is to generate a geospatial visualisation of New York City with a specific focus on the tips of taxi passengers throughout many of the cityâ€™s locations. Therefore, the aim is to locate points in which part of the city do passengers tend to tip their taxi trips in a considerable amount.The datasets used involve the New York City taxi, retrieved from the Taxi and Limousine Commission: https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page.
## Summary
There are many variables that can contribute to tipping in taxis, such as time and location. By generating a geospatial visualisation, we can determine which places generate high taxi tip amounts. This can by analysing a dataset and determine past behaviour from previous taxi trips. The dataset used is large and raw, and pre-processing has been made.
